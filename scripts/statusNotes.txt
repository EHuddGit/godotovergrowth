player and bullet scenes:
//need to move all animations to process and take them out of physics process
// timing of the sprite shooting the bullet and the bullet coming out seems off
// will need to add code to turn off the bullet created flag for when the animation switches from
shooting to not shooting

bullet scene:
//bullet sprite needs to be flipped
// will probably have to change when spawning bullet gets unlocked to run instead of signal when the animation is done
// will have to change bullet's root node to something that can use collisions
