minimum requirements to finish:
- switch out all the resource sprites ✓

- make sprite adjustments to the resources to change between states visually

- a wave system
    - have a timer ontop that changes red or green to signify a wave
    - spawns in enemies during a wave ✓
    - change enemy behavior to move towards the middle of the map

- fix the soldier's system of locking on player and extend range

- implement building barricades ✓
    - adding an upgrade pop up ✓
    - change phases of upgraded barricades ✓
    - probably requires popup with resource costs and its own button to build it ✓
- implement player health
- fix bullet spawn timing ✓
- FIX CLUMPING
    - overall decided to put each soldier and enemy on slightly different leveling
        - will need to look at collisions to make sure they still work
    - or give a small variance on where to arrive to attack
    - have them attack at slightly different times

- make sure bullets only hit one enemy

- soldiers are glitchin ✓(maybe)

where i want to finish:
- change and polish soldier sprites with adjustments
- add hit visual changes
- have soldiers move between player y and resource y when needed

basically whats left:
- make sure bullets hit one enemy by turning their collison off on collison //putting this one on hold
- add the rest of the map
- finish wave system (add a pause button to the wave system)
- adjust enemy sprites and attack distances ✓ (but the attack is abit off)
- have a lose screen that pauses all nodes
- have both the player and enemy start having health and trigger lose screen
- have a pause menu that returns back to main menu

if i have time:
- fix glitch with first bullet not spawning
- add in hit shader
- have soldiers and enemies spawn on slightly different heights
